# A.I.M.S.

## What is this?

This project is just something I threw together to practice Graphql, Gatsby, and semantic-ui-react. I was very interested in Graphql and wanted to get used to querying info.

The goal of this project is just pull info from Anilist and display it on the screen in an interesting way. I think we succeeded.

## How to use it

`npm install` to get the dependencies, then `npm run develop` to start the development server.
